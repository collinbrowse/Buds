# Buds
An app designed to personalize cannabis. 

## Overview

Allows you to track your activity with cannabis, which gives a personalized view of what works for you. Cannabis is a new industry to many people so Buds helps by tracking what works and what doesn't so that everyone can have positive experiences every time. 

### Project Status

Buds is being actively being updated. It was originally created as a fun side project to work on new skills. This past winter development was put on hold but has been resumed as of April 2020. Buds is currently being refactored to incorporate new techniques learned from recent professional experience and online courses. 

## Features

* Create a new account with name, username, birthday, location, email, password and profile picture. User authentication and login/logout features implemented using FirebaseAuth. Profile Pictures are stored in Firebase Storage
* Add a recent experience with the strain, a rating, the method of consumption, the location of the activity, description of the experience and the effects it had
* A feed of the user's most recent activity with associated details. This allows access to recent experiences so the user can quickly remember what they liked. For example, when in a dispensary a user can find what worked for them so they can make an informed decision
* The ability to search and filter for new strains and get descriptions and effects for each strain
* A page to view favorite strains and effects (sleep, headaches, etc.). From here the user can access details and descriptions of each strain along with any experiences they had with it
